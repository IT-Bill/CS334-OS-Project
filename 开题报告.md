Week 1:

- Understand the project background and goals, study the structure and design of Rust-FreeRTOS.
- Study the TCB and TaskHandle structures in FreeRTOS, learn how to call task functions using the Callback mechanism.
- Familiarize oneself with Cargo feature's kernel trimming functionality and understand the handling of global variables.

Week 2:

- Design the overall architecture of the project, including modular design and task control function design.
- Begin to tackle implementation challenges, such as how to handle basic data structures like linked lists and how to add tasks to the ready list.

Week 3:

- Begin implementing task API functions, including task creation, deletion, and suspension.
- Design and implement task delay functions, adding tasks to the delayed queue.
- Begin preliminary testing of implemented functions.

Week 4:

- Begin designing and implementing Queue and Semaphore, including data structures and implementation methods.
- Tackle the issue of converting between Generic T and Option<TaskHandle>.

Week 5:

- Complete implementation of Queue and Semaphore, including creation, acquisition, and release of signals.
- Begin performance testing, including C performance testing methods and Rust performance testing methods.

Week 6:

- Summarize and evaluate the entire project, including functionality correctness, performance testing results, and issues that remain.
- Summarize project experiences and lessons learned, propose suggestions for improvement and optimization.
- Prepare final report, providing detailed explanations and introductions to the project.
