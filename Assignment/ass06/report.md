## Assignment 6

## 1. Cooperation between hardware and OS

### Address translation

Transforms each memory access , changing the **virtual** address provided by the instruction to a **physical** address where the desired information is actually located.

### Hardware Support

## 2. differences between segmentation and paging

#### size of chunks

- Segmentation divides the virtual address space into variable-sized segments, where each segment corresponds to a logical unit of the program (e.g., code, data, stack).
- Paging divides the virtual address space into fixed-sized pages, typically ranging from 4KB to 2MB.

#### management of free space

- Segmentation
  - The space that this library manages is known historically as the heap, and the generic data structure used to manage free space in the heap is some kind of **free list**. This structure contains references to all of the free chunks of space in the managed region of memory. 
  - Not regular: we have a number of segments per process, and each segment might be a different size, then there are many free space which have different size.
  - malloc strategies: best-fit, worst-fit, first-fit, buddy algorithm, etc.
  - issue: easy to waste many space because of external 

- Paging
  - Also use free list to manage free space.
  - Regular: Paging divides the virtual address space into fixed-sized page
  - Flexibility: with a fully-developed paging approach, the system will be able to support the abstraction of an address space effectively, regardless of how a process uses the address space; we wonâ€™t, for example, make assumptions about the direction the heap and stack grow and how they are used.
  - simplicity: For example, when the OS wishes to place our tiny 64-byte address space into our eight-page physical memory, it simply finds four free pages; perhaps the OS keeps a free list of all free pages for this, and just grabs the first four free pages off of this list.

#### context switch overhead

- Segmentation requires saving and restoring the pointers, bases and bounds of the heap, code and stack, which can be expensive in terms of context switch overhead.

- Paging requires only saving and restoring page table pointers, which is much faster.

#### fragmentation

- Segmentation:
  - suffers from external fragmentation, which can lead to a significant amount of memory waste.
  - remedies: compact physical memory by rearranging the existing segments.

- Paging suffers from internal fragmentation, which can also waste some memory but is typically less severe than external fragmentation.

#### status bits and protect bits

- Segmentation and paging requires a status bit for each page to indicate whether it is currently in memory or not. It also requires a protection bit for each page to control access rights.

Because the Page table entry size is 4 Bytes and page size is 8 KBytes, then the number of PTEs in one page table is 8KB / 4Byte = 2<sup>11</sup>. Hence, we need 33 / 11 = 3 levels.
